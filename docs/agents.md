## Default Agents — Always Active on Code Changes

These seven agents activate **automatically** on every code change, deployment,
or infrastructure modification. No trigger needed. They represent the baseline
engineering team that protects every change going to production.

| Agent | Role | Auto-Triggers On | Key Checks |
|-------|------|-------------------|------------|
| **Infra Agent** | DNS, CDN, CI/CD, hosting, uptime | `.github/workflows/`, `wrangler.jsonc`, deployment config | Cloudflare config, DNS, edge deployment, build pipeline |
| **Security Agent** | Threats, CSP, dependency audit | Any code change | XSS, injection, secrets exposure, CSP headers, dependency CVEs |
| **Build Agent** | Code quality, testing, PR review | `.astro`, `.ts`, `.css`, `.mdx` changes | Build passes, code standards, TypeScript errors, MDX frontmatter |
| **Brand Agent** | Colors, fonts, voice, identity | Any UI/content change | 4-color system, font stack, voice guidelines, visual consistency |
| **QA Agent** | A11y, Lighthouse, responsive | Page/component changes | WCAG AA, heading hierarchy, Lighthouse 95+, mobile breakpoints |
| **GitHub Agent** | Workflows, Actions, branch protection | `.github/` changes, PRs, deploys | Workflow syntax, secret handling, action versions, CI/CD pipeline |
| **Prose Agent** | Human language, AI-ism detection | Any `.astro`, `.mdx`, `.md`, `.json` with visible text | Em dashes, AI vocabulary, passive voice, sentence length, voice compliance |

### How Default Agents Work
- **On every code PR:** Build Agent validates build, Security Agent scans for
  vulnerabilities, Brand Agent checks color/font compliance, QA Agent verifies
  accessibility
- **On deployment changes:** Infra Agent validates Cloudflare config, GitHub Agent
  checks workflow syntax, Security Agent reviews secrets handling
- **On content changes:** Brand Agent enforces voice guidelines, QA Agent checks
  heading hierarchy and meta tags, Build Agent validates MDX frontmatter,
  Prose Agent scans for AI-isms and enforces human language
- **On going live (production deploy):** All seven agents run a final gate check.
  Infra Agent confirms DNS/CDN, Security Agent runs a production scan, GitHub
  Agent validates the CI/CD pipeline ran green, Prose Agent confirms human voice

## Mode + Domain Trigger System

The Relay Method™ now supports a **Mode + Domain** shorthand for faster,
more precise agent activation. Use a mode prefix to tell the agent HOW
to behave, combined with a domain family for WHAT expertise to use.

### Operation Modes

Every interaction can start with a mode that controls agent behavior.
Both symbol and word prefixes are supported — they are equivalent.

| Symbol | Word | Mode | Behavior |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| `?` | `check` | **Check** | Read-only. Audit, review, report. No code changes. |
| `!` | `do` | **Do** | Execute. Write code, fix issues, produce commits. |
| `~` | `think` | **Think** | Brainstorm. Explore ideas, research, no changes. |

**Rules:**
- `check` mode agents must NEVER modify files — only read, analyze, report
- `think` mode agents must NEVER modify files — only discuss and propose
- `do` mode is the only mode that produces code changes
- If no mode is specified, the agent infers from context
- Modes work with ALL triggers (one-word, domain, contextual, service-tier)

### Domain Families

Seven memorable domains group agents by business function:

| Domain | Covers | Maps To |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **code** | Engineering, architecture, build, frontend, backend, APIs | `/architect`, `/build`, `/frontend`, `/backend`, `/datamodel`, `/api`, `/devops` |
| **brand** | Colors, fonts, voice, design, UI/UX, aesthetics | `/audit`, `/brandfix`, `/prettify`, `/brand`, `/ui`, `/ux` |
| **growth** | Marketing, SEO, content, social, ads, email | `/seo`, `/content`, `/growth`, `/social`, `/ads` |
| **ops** | Infrastructure, CI/CD, deployment, security, GitHub | `/infra`, `/security`, `/github` |
| **biz** | Sales, deals, proposals, pipeline, outbound | `/outbound`, `/deals`, `/proposal`, `/coach`, `/pipeline` |
| **plan** | Strategy, research, sprint planning, roadmap | `/plan`, `/research`, `/sprint` |
| **qa** | Testing, accessibility, Lighthouse, compliance | `/qa`, `/superpowers` |

### Usage Examples

| What You Type | What Happens |
|---------------|--------------|
| `?brand` or `check brand` | Audit brand compliance. Report only, no changes. |
| `!brand` or `do brand` | Fix all brand violations in code. |
| `~brand` or `think brand` | Brainstorm brand direction and messaging. |
| `?code` or `check code` | Architecture review, code quality audit. |
| `!code` or `do code` | Build features, fix bugs, write code. |
| `~growth` or `think growth` | Workshop marketing strategy and campaign ideas. |
| `?qa` or `check qa` | Full QA audit — accessibility, Lighthouse, responsive. |
| `!ops` or `do ops` | Fix deployment issues, update workflows. |
| `~biz` or `think biz` | Workshop deal strategy, explore pricing. |

Modes also work with specific triggers: `?seo`, `!brandfix`, `~architect`.

### Deterministic Routing Rules

When a Mode + Domain combo is used, these agents activate automatically:

| Input | Agents Activated | Allowed Actions |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `?code` | BMAD *architect + Build Agent + Security Agent | Read, analyze, report only |
| `!code` | BMAD *dev + Build Agent | Modify files, commit (only *dev writes) |
| `?brand` | Brand Agent + Prose Agent | Read, analyze, report only |
| `!brand` | BMAD *dev (brand) + Brand Agent | Fix violations, commit |
| `?ops` | Infra + Security + GitHub Agents | Read, analyze, report (NO `npm run build`) |
| `!ops` | Infra Agent + DevOps Automator | Fix infra issues, commit |
| `?growth` | BMAD *pm (SEO) + Content Creator | Audit content and SEO, report |
| `!growth` | Content Creator + Growth Hacker | Write content, commit |
| `~plan` | BMAD *analyst + *pm | Research and plan (no file edits) |
| `~biz` | Deal Strategist + Proposal Strategist | Workshop strategy (no file edits) |
| `?qa` | QA Agent | Accessibility, Lighthouse, responsive audit |
| `!qa` | QA Agent + BMAD *dev | Fix accessibility issues, commit |

### Directory-Based Defaults

When no explicit trigger is given, agents auto-select based on edited files:

| Directory | Default Mode + Domain | Side-Checks |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| `src/pages/`, `src/components/` | `!code` | Brand + QA |
| `src/content/blog/` | `!growth` | Brand + Prose |
| `src/styles/` | `!code` | Brand |
| `public/` | `?brand` | (no code changes) |
| `.github/workflows/` | `?ops` | Security + GitHub |
| `wrangler.jsonc` | `?ops` | Infra + Security |
| `docs/` | `~plan` | (no code changes) |

### Compatibility

This system is **additive** — all existing triggers work unchanged.
Mode + Domain is an optional layer for faster, clearer communication.

---

## The Ship Gate — Coordinating Multi-Agent Work

When multiple agents work in parallel, use the **Ship Gate** to prevent
premature pushes and ensure clean delivery.

### Rules

- Agents CAN commit locally at any time (incremental saves are fine)
- Agents must NOT push to remote without `/ship`
- Agents must NOT create PRs without `/ship`

### The `/ship` Command

When you type `/ship`, the following sequence runs:

1. **Freeze** — All agents stop making changes
2. **Gate check** — All 7 default agents run final review:
   - Build Agent: `npm run build` passes
   - Security Agent: No secrets, no injection vectors
   - Brand Agent: 4-color system, font stack, voice compliance
   - QA Agent: Accessibility, heading hierarchy, Lighthouse targets
   - Prose Agent: No AI-isms in text content
   - Infra Agent: Config files valid (if changed)
   - GitHub Agent: Workflow syntax valid (if changed)
3. **Report** — Results presented to you
4. **Push** — If all gates pass (or you override), push to remote
5. **PR** — Create PR with consolidated summary of all changes

### Emergency Override

- `/ship --force` — Push immediately, skip gate checks (use sparingly)

---

## Agent Self-Optimization — `/relay optimize`

Use the agents to review and improve their own instructions.

**Trigger:** `/relay optimize`
**Agents:** All BMAD lifecycle agents + default agents + Agency wrappers

### Workflow

1. **Self-audit** — Each agent reads its own prompt file, identifies gaps,
   outdated references, or missing constraints
2. **Cross-audit** — Each agent reads adjacent prompt files, finds overlaps,
   contradictions, or coverage gaps between agents
3. **Propose** — Updated prompt files generated with `-v2` suffix
   (e.g., `bmad-seo-v2.prompt.md`)
4. **Changelog** — Generate `docs/agent-changelog-YYYY-MM-DD.md` listing
   all changes, rationale, and open questions
5. **PR** — Create a PR branch: `claude/agent-optimizations-YYYY-MM-DD`
6. **Human review** — All proposals go through PR review (never auto-deploy)

### Output Artifacts

Every `/relay optimize` run must produce:

| Artifact | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Updated prompt files | `.github/prompts/` | One file per modified agent |
| Changelog | `docs/agent-changelog-YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Changes + rationale + open questions |
| Updated agents.md | `docs/agents.md` | Reflect any new agents, triggers, or routing |
| Updated CLAUDE.md | `CLAUDE.md` | Reflect any new prompt files or constraints |
| PR branch | `claude/agent-optimizations-YYYY-MM-DD` | Reviewable change set |

### Schedule

Run quarterly or when:
- Adding new agents or prompt files
- Changing service tiers or brand standards
- After a major build that reveals process gaps
- When multiple agents produce conflicting guidance

## The Relay Method™ — How It Works

The Relay Method™ organizes AI agent assistance into four layers:

| Layer | Purpose | Source |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **1. BMAD Lifecycle Agents** | Structured agile roles for the full SDLC (plan, build, test, ship) | BMAD Method |
| **2. Agency Domain Specialists** | Deep-expertise personas for subject-matter knowledge | The Agency |
| **3. Superpowers Workflow Engine** | Structured multi-step development workflow (brainstorm → ship) | Superpowers |
| **4. RelayLaunch Business Context** | Service-tier workflows and brand standards | Internal |

### Layer 1: BMAD Lifecycle Agents
Structured agile roles that manage the full software development lifecycle.
These are the "process" agents — they know *how* to plan, build, test, and ship.

| Role | Trigger | Specialty | Prompt File |
|------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| *analyst | `/research` | Research & discovery | `bmad-research.prompt.md` |
| *pm | `/plan` | Requirements & prioritization | `bmad-plan.prompt.md` |
| *architect | `/architect` | Technical design & structure | `bmad-architect.prompt.md` |
| *architect | `/datamodel` | Data model & schema review | `bmad-data-model.prompt.md` |
| *architect | `/api` | API endpoint review & validation | `bmad-api-review.prompt.md` |
| *sm | `/sprint` | Story creation & sprint planning | `bmad-sprint.prompt.md` |
| *dev | `/build` | Implementation & code | `bmad-build.prompt.md` |
| *dev | `/brandfix` | Brand color violation fixes | `bmad-brand-fix.prompt.md` |
| *dev + *qa | `/prettify` | Aesthetic polish | `bmad-prettify.prompt.md` |
| *qa | `/qa` | Testing, audit & compliance | `bmad-qa.prompt.md` |
| *qa | `/audit` | Brand compliance audit | `bmad-audit.prompt.md` |

### Layer 2: Agency Domain Specialists
Deep-expertise personas that bring subject-matter knowledge. These are the
"what" agents — they know the craft inside and out. Source files live in
`external/agency-agents/` (git submodule). RelayLaunch wrapper prompt files
in `.github/prompts/` import the originals and add brand/stack constraints.

| Trigger | Agent | Wrapper Prompt File |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| `/frontend` | Frontend Developer | `agency-frontend-developer.prompt.md` |
| `/backend` | Backend Architect | `agency-backend-architect.prompt.md` |
| `/devops` | DevOps Automator | `agency-devops-automator.prompt.md` |
| `/brand` | Brand Guardian | `agency-brand-guardian.prompt.md` |
| `/content` | Content Creator | `agency-content-creator.prompt.md` |
| `/growth` | Growth Hacker | `agency-growth-hacker.prompt.md` |
| `/proposal` | Proposal Strategist | `agency-proposal-strategist.prompt.md` |

### Layer 3: Superpowers Workflow Engine
Structured multi-step development workflow that enforces a systematic process
from brainstorming through shipping. Activated via `/superpowers`.

### Layer 4: RelayLaunch Business Context
Service-tier workflows and brand standards that ground every agent in
RelayLaunch's specific business model, pricing, voice, and client delivery.

| Prose Agent | `bmad-prose.prompt.md` | _(auto-triggers on content)_ | Human language enforcement, AI-ism detection |
| Infra Agent | `bmad-infra.prompt.md` | `/infra` | DNS, CDN, CI/CD, hosting review |
| Security Agent | `bmad-security.prompt.md` | `/security` | Threat detection, vulnerability scanning, CSP |
| GitHub Agent | `bmad-github.prompt.md` | `/github` | Workflows, Actions, branch protection |

### Agency Specialist Wrappers

These thin wrappers import the original Agency agent instructions from
`external/agency-agents/` and add RelayLaunch brand rules and stack constraints.

| Agent | Prompt File | Trigger | Source |
|-------|-------------|---------|--------|
| Frontend Developer | `agency-frontend-developer.prompt.md` | `/frontend` | `engineering/engineering-frontend-developer.md` |
| Backend Architect | `agency-backend-architect.prompt.md` | `/backend` | `engineering/engineering-backend-architect.md` |
| DevOps Automator | `agency-devops-automator.prompt.md` | `/devops` | `engineering/engineering-devops-automator.md` |
| Brand Guardian | `agency-brand-guardian.prompt.md` | `/brand` | `design/design-brand-guardian.md` |
| Content Creator | `agency-content-creator.prompt.md` | `/content` | `marketing/marketing-content-creator.md` |
| Growth Hacker | `agency-growth-hacker.prompt.md` | `/growth` | `marketing/marketing-growth-hacker.md` |
| Proposal Strategist | `agency-proposal-strategist.prompt.md` | `/proposal` | `sales/sales-proposal-strategist.md` |

### Adding New Prompt Files

Create a file in `.github/prompts/` with this format:

```markdown
---
mode: agent
description: "BMAD *role agent — Short description"
---

# Task Title — *role Agent

You are the BMAD *role agent. [Instructions...]
```

## Superpowers Integration

When complex multi-step tasks arise, use `/superpowers` to activate the
structured workflow:

### Phases

1. **Brainstorm** — Refine ideas through clarifying questions before coding
2. **Plan** — Break work into small, testable tasks (2-5 min each)
3. **Execute** — Implement tasks with review checkpoints using subagents
4. **Test** — RED-GREEN-REFACTOR test-driven methodology
5. **Review** — Validate work against the implementation plan
6. **Finish** — Handle branch merging and cleanup

### When to Use

- New feature implementations spanning multiple files
- Refactoring tasks that touch core architecture
- Bug fixes requiring systematic debugging
- Any task that benefits from structured planning

### Combo Triggers

- `/superpowers` + `/architect` → Structured architecture design with planning
- `/superpowers` + `/build` → TDD feature implementation with review checkpoints
- `/superpowers` + `/qa` → Systematic audit with test-driven validation

## Cross-Repo Agent Setup

Both `relaylaunch-website` and `relaylaunch-control-center` should maintain
a copy of this file at `docs/agents.md` so AI tools in either repo know the
full agent roster. The website repo is the source of truth for this file.

When setting up a new repo in the RelayLaunch ecosystem:

1. Copy `docs/agents.md` into the new repo
2. Add BMAD prompt files to `.github/prompts/` as needed
3. Reference agents in `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
4. Install frameworks: `npx bmad-method install` and copy Agency agents

## About The Relay Method™

The Relay Method™ is a proprietary framework developed by RelayLaunch LLC
for orchestrating AI agents across the full spectrum of digital business
operations — from code to content to client delivery.

It combines:
- **BMAD Method** for structured agile development lifecycle
- **The Agency** for deep domain specialist expertise
- **Superpowers** for systematic multi-step development workflows
- **RelayLaunch business context** for service-tier workflows and brand standards
- **Mode + Domain** trigger system for precise, memorable agent activation

The name reflects the relay race metaphor: each specialist picks up the
baton, runs their leg with precision, and hands off cleanly to the next.
Just like a relay team, the method is faster than any individual and every
handoff is deliberate.
